# Prediction-of-the-Main-Oscillation-Power-and-Spurious-Levels-in-Optoelectronic-Oscillators


Conventional dual-loop OEOs proposed to suppress the spurious modes exhibit degraded phase-noise performance compared with single-loop OEOs because of the short fibre loop in dual-loop OEOs. 

To overcome the decrease in phase-noise performance, we investigated theoretically and experimentally the open-loop characteristics of the dual-loop OEO. 

We found that the spurious modes can be eliminated without degradation in the phase-noise performance by adequately controlling the open-loop gain of the OEO. 

Through gain control, we successfully demonstrated the suppression of spurious modes by more than 21 dB.
